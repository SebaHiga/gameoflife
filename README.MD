> The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine. 

# Dev notes to you!
I just wanted to play with Rust and at the same time I got interested in Conway's game of life, so I though it would be a good idea to try learning Rust while coding this marvelous game.

# Build and run
``` sh
$ cargo run
```

# Run it with docker
``` sh
$ docker run -it sebhig/gameoflife
